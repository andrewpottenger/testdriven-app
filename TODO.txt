Part 4 TODOS
1. Try re-factoring 'FormErrors.test.js' into a for loop, like we did with the form component tests.

2. Validation logic for validateForm() and validateEmail() in our unit tests.

3.User does not exist isn't really accurate if the error was due to an incorrect password.
Login failed is probably a better generic error message. Check your understanding and
update this on your own.

4. Is there any way to mock the wait time so that the test doesn't actually take an extra four
seconds to run?
